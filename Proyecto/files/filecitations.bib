  abstract={Data sharing in cloud computing enables multiple participants to freely share the group data, which improves the efficiency of work in cooperative environments and has widespread potential applications. However, how to ensure the security of data sharing within a group and how to efficiently share the outsourced data in a group manner are formidable challenges. Note that key agreement protocols have played a very important role in secure and efficient group data sharing in cloud computing. In this paper, by taking advantage of the symmetric balanced incomplete block design (SBIBD), we present a novel block design-based key agreement protocol that supports multiple participants, which can flexibly extend the number of participants in a cloud environment according to the structure of the block design. Based on the proposed group data sharing model, we present general formulas for generating the common conference key $\mathcal {K}$K for multiple participants. Note that by benefiting from the $(v,k + 1,1)$(v,k+1,1)-block design, the computational complexity of the proposed protocol linearly increases with the number of participants and the communication complexity is greatly reduced. In addition, the fault tolerance property of our protocol enables the group data sharing in cloud computing to withstand different key attacks, which is similar to Yi's protocol.},

  title={A Critical Study on Hybrid Computing and Its Current Influences and Future Challenges}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This research focuses on the evolving field of hybrid computing, which combines traditional computing architectures with advanced computational paradigms like quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, or cloud-edge computing. Hybrid computing involves integrating multiple computing models or systems to leverage their complementary strengths. For example, combining classical computing with quantum or neuromorphic approaches to solve complex problems more efficiently. The goal is to enhance computational power, increase efficiency, and tackle problems that are difficult for traditional computing models alone. Emerging technologies, including quantum computing, machine learning, and AI, are driving the need for hybrid systems. These technologies enable the handling of more complex computations that classical systems struggle with, such as optimization, simulation, and cryptography. The integration of cloud and edge computing is also central to hybrid computing, enabling decentralized computation and processing closer to data sources. Combining different computing paradigms requires seamless communication and integration between systems, which is a significant technical challenge. Main challenging areas are scalability, software and hardware compatibility, energy efficiency and security. There is a need for standard protocols and frameworks to enable smoother integration of various computing systems. New algorithms that can take advantage of hybrid architectures need to be developed. Depend on applications significant advancements in hardware, including quantum processors, neuromorphic chips, and integrated hybrid processors required. The rise of hybrid computing will also bring ethical concerns, such as the impact on jobs, privacy, and inequality in access to advanced technologies. The study concludes by emphasizing the transformative potential of hybrid computing while acknowledging the technical, economic, and societal hurdles that need to be overcome. It highlights that while significant progress is being made, realizing the full potential of hybrid computing will require continued research, collaboration, and innovation across multiple domains. In summary, hybrid computing is poised to revolutionize many fields by merging the strengths of various computational models, but its widespread adoption will require overcoming substantial technical, economic, and regulatory challenges.},

  abstract={In the last few years, Internet of Things, Cloud computing, Edge computing, and Fog computing have gained a lot of attention in both industry and academia. However, a clear and neat definition of these computing paradigms and their correlation is hard to find in the literature. This makes it difficult for researchers new to this area to get a concrete picture of these paradigms. This work tackles this deficiency, representing a helpful resource for those who will start next. First, we show the evolution of modern computing paradigms and related research interest. Then, we address each paradigm, neatly delineating its key points and its relation with the others. Thereafter, we extensively address Fog computing, remarking its outstanding role as the glue between IoT, Cloud, and Edge computing. In the end, we briefly present open challenges and future research directions for IoT, Cloud, Edge, and Fog computing.},

  abstract={Grid Computing is often implemented by relying on the concept of sharing of available resources, in order to improve economies of scale and utilization. However, after the advent of Cloud Computing, the adoption of Grid Computing has been rather slow, and people wonder if it is still relevant, and whether Grid Computing truly matters. In a developing country like India where computer, smart phone and internet penetration is still low compared to richer nations, Grid Computing can make a huge difference in the adoption of scientific computing, by making niche resources available to the researchers. Grid Computing provides a framework to bridge the gap between what the researchers want and what they currently have. Grid aggregates available resources through efficient security mechanisms, meta-scheduling capabilities, and file transfer methodologies among others, and offers an unprecedented infrastructure for solving grand challenge problems. Grid Computing is here to stay, though it may not become as common as Cloud Computing, since it targets a comparatively niche set of users. It is also felt that the proponents of Grid Computing need to come up with new ideas and paradigms to improve the relevance of the grid in the changed scenario of computing.},

  abstract={When it comes to storage and computation of large scales of data, Cloud Computing has acted as the de-facto solution over the past decade. However, with the massive growth in intelligent and mobile devices coupled with technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), V2X Communications, Augmented Reality (AR), the focus has shifted towards gaining real-time responses along with support for context-awareness and mobility. Due to the delays induced on the Wide Area Network (WAN) and location agnostic provisioning of resources on the cloud, there is a need to bring the features of the cloud closer to the consumer devices. This led to the birth of the Edge Computing paradigm which aims to provide context aware storage and distributed Computing at the edge of the networks. In this paper, we discuss the three different implementations of Edge Computing namely Fog Computing, Cloudlet and Mobile Edge Computing in detail and compare their features. We define a set of parameters based on which one of these implementations can be chosen optimally given a particular use-case or application and present a decision tree for the selection of the optimal implementation.},

  pages={331-337},
  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are pervasively used in a large number of applications, such as Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri, and Google Now. The traditional method is to offload them in the cloud, which causes serious data transmission delay and high network resource cost, as well as user privacy leakage. The emergence of Mobile Edge Computing(MEC) provides a new solution for the execution of DNN-based applications. With the increase of the computing power of mobile devices and the appearance of edge nodes, offloading partial layers of the DNN-based application to the edge will speed up system response, reduce the burden of cloud center and protect privacy of users. Most of existing researches focus on the optimization of response delay for DNN-based applications in edge computing system, but there is no mature solution to the cost optimization of edge computing system. To effectively reduce the cost of edge computing for offloading DNN-based applications, we propose a offloading strategy based on Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization with Genetic Operators(DPSO-GO). By introducing crossover operator and mutation operator of genetic algorithm, it overcomes the defect that the traditional PSO algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum. The results show that our algorithm can reduce the cost of edge computing system effectively while satisfying the delay requirements of all the DNN-based applications.},

  abstract={Medical data is invaluable in medical diagnosis. With the recent advance in Internet of Things (IoT) and non-invasive sensing, massive medical data can be gathered in real-time but how to process them efficiently becomes a big challenge for e-Health applications. In this demo paper, we investigate the idea of employing Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) which can provide computing resources close to the end devices with a variety of computation offloading models to facilitate real-time medical data processing. To evaluate this idea and find out which computation offloading model can achieve the best performance, we implement COMEC where a video-based heart rate detection APP is running in a MEC environment based on Open Air Interface (OAI). Experimental results have shown that the best performance is achieved under multi-layer offloading model where both the edge server and the cloud server are employed.},

  abstract={Recent advances in pervasive computing and service-oriented computing have led to a desire to better support user-oriented tasks. Task computing is a new paradigm that tries to provide computational support for humans in terms of their tasks that the human is involved in, which has become a driving force in realizing the vision of pervasive computing. One of the key challenges of task computing paradigm is how to build the appropriate infrastructure in filling the gap between the tasks and the services. To solve the problem, this paper puts forward a user-centric task computing architecture for heterogeneous and dynamic pervasive computing environments which called U-TCA. The U-TCA focuses on sensing and abstracting user's requirement based task model on the one hand, and using middleware to mask the heterogeneity of computing environment on the other hand. The key technologies of the U-TCA are also discussed in detail, including the techniques of task acquisition, task modeling and task mapping.},

  abstract={In recent years, cloud computing has emerged as a major change in the world of technology, whereby computing workloads are transferred first from local data centers located within companies and organizations to large cloud centers. On the horizon, a new wave of change forces the transition from cloud computing to edge computing, which is located at the borders of networks so that computation is close to the source of the processed data. This is to improve the performance and reliability of applications and services, and reduce the cost of their operation by optimizing the distance of the traveled data. In a mobile environment, we have to ask for the best technology to handle such an environment, whether it be cloud computing or edge computing. This survey will go over several papers varying from cloud computing to mobile edge computing to understand the researchers’ focus. We will see that mobility is a simple phenomenon that will help the emergence of new technologies.},

  abstract={In a service computing environment, Web service is maintained by various stakeholders including content providers, users and integration vendors of the service computing environment. These stakeholders make decisions about software/product license structure and billing system of services they are involved in. Service computing environment can be regarded as being provided and maintained as a synthesis of all these individual services. However, to make this service computing environment a sustainable one, validity of billing structure and fairness of cost burden among users need to be satisfactory from the users' perspective. The purpose of this study is to clarify, from a gaming experiment on the Internet, how users using a service computing environment will react to cost burden rules of certain services. In the experiment, highly public service operation model such as Language Grid was assumed and user behavior was investigated by combining incentive effect, its nature as a social investment and its nature as a Donationware where the payment of compensation for use is left to the user's judgement. As a result, it was clarified that users' behavior had a certain pattern with regards to interest and passivity towards donation and investment.},

  abstract={The underutilized resources from nearby wired devices can be shared to compute for the restricted mobile devices at the edge of network. In this letter, we propose the share-based edge computing (SEC) paradigm with the mobile-to-wired (M2W) offloading computing. By sharing the idle resources under control of SEC servers, tasks from mobile devices can be computed on wired devices. Moreover, a well-designed computing allocation and sharing (CAS) algorithm is proposed to ensure the low fail ratio and the high utilization ratio of the SEC paradigm. Numerical results demonstrate the SEC paradigm has a better performance compared to local computing and mobile edge computing (MEC).},

These paradigms offer distinct approaches to address the challenges of mobile application development, resource management, and latency reduction. MECC combines the benefits of MCC and MEC, integrating cloud and edge resources to leverage their respective advantages. MECC offers a hybrid architecture where tasks can be dynamically allocated between cloud servers and edge nodes based on factors such as task requirements, latency constraints, and resource availability. This paper presents a comprehensive review through the comparative analysis of MCC, MEC, and MECC, focusing on key aspects such as architecture, resource allocation, latency reduction, and scalability.},

  abstract={Cache resource allocation is the main challenging and practically important issues of Information-Centric Networking (ICN). Although many studies have exploited optimized cache resource allocation to enhance the caching efficiency and the performance of the network, little attention has been paid to the minimization of user energy consumption. To fill in this gap, this study focuses on optimized allocating cache resource to closer user and form a connected network with minimum time delay and energy consumption. To this end, the caching resource allocation (CRA) problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: BS caching capacity (BSCC) problem and Request MATching (RMAT) problem. We then solve BSCC and RMAT one by one and combine their solutions to address the CRA problem.},

  abstract={Dew Computing (DC) is a comparatively modern field with a wide range of applications. By examining how technological advances such as fog, edge and Dew computing, and distributed intelligence force us to reconsider traditional Cloud Computing (CC) to serve the Internet of Things. A new dew estimation theory is presented in this article. The revised definition is as follows: DC is a software and hardware cloud-based company. On-premises servers provide autonomy and collaborate with cloud networks. Dew Calculation aims to enhance the capabilities of on-premises and cloud-based applications. These categories can result in the development of new applications. In the world, there has been rapid growth in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), starting with Grid Computing (GC), CC, Fog Computing (FC), and the latest Edge Computing (EC) technology. DC technologies, infrastructure, and applications are described. We’ll go through the newest developments in fog networking, QoE, cloud at the edge, platforms, security, and privacy. The dew-cloud architecture is an option concerning the current client-server architecture, where two servers are located at opposite ends. In the absence of an Internet connection, a dew server helps users browse and track their details. Data are primarily stored as a local copy on the dew server that starts the Internet and is synchronized with the cloud master copy. The local dew pages, a local online version of the current website, can be browsed, read, written, or added to the users. Mapping between different Local Dew sites has been made possible using the dew domain name scheme and dew domain redirection.},

  abstract={Heterogeneous edge computing has become a new computing paradigm with the aim of moving the computation away from cloud towards the edge of the network. With the rapid increase in communication data volume, changing the network structure to provide hard real-time services is one of the goals of edge computing. A proper testbed is essential for fully validating edge computing algorithms, especially for computation offloading. In this paper, we present a scalable testbed for task offloading and deployment of heterogeneous edge computing adopting cross-platform container technique to encapsulate the software environment and runtime dependencies of heterogeneous computing units. extensive experiments have demonstrated that containers do not bring extra time consumption or occupy extra computing resources.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is a paradigm that offers a restricted set of virtualized resources that may be accessed as needed. It is crucial to allocate these resources on target machines in a manner that minimizes both inadequate utilization and excess utilization, as these conditions can result in substantial consumption of energy. The term “nano data centers” refers to a network of widely dispersed computers that have the capability to both host and distribute material and solicitations in a peer-to-peer manner. The investigation of energy usage in nano servers has not been extensively explored, despite their increasing popularity. Several findings have been derived from our study, which highlight the aspects within the system design that enable nDCs to achieve lower energy consumption compared to their centralized counterparts. This paper presents a comprehensive definition of Cloud Frameworks, encompassing many platforms such as edge computing, green computing, parallel computing, distributed computing, and fog computing. In conclusion, this study highlights a number of obstacles and potential within the realm of cloud computing. It is our intention that this work will attract the interest of the academic community and serve as a catalyst for further investigation in this domain.},

  abstract={Multi-access edge computing provides a low-latency and high-performance network environment for the Internet of Vehicle services by migrating computing and storage resources to the edge of networks and supports the deployment of more regional-specific vehicle-to-everything services. In this paper, we propose a fusion perception method for roadside cameras and millimeter wave radar as an application of edge computing. First, we used YOLOv3 to process camera data and DBSCAN clustering method to process radar data to obtain the position, speed, and category of detections. Next, we used joint calibration to spatially synchronize camera and radar data and a direct update method to temporally synchronize camera and radar data. Furthermore, we used the Munkres algorithm to associate camera and radar detections, and Kalman filter to track the proposed fusion method's perception results. Finally, we conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},
